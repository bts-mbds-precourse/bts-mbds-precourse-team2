# Project Description / Abstract

Few lines explaining what your project consist on is always useful, so people don't have to read the code to understand what you are doing.

# Dataset

You should include some lines explaining the dataset you are using, together with the link where you can download the data (if dealing with a public dataset).

# Files and usage
You should explain all the files that you include, as well as how to use them.

For example

    main.py: This file contains the core of the project.
    plot_graphs.py: This file contains functions that graph data into different formats
    ...
    ...
**Usage**: Run the following command line into your terminal:

    python main.py
    
# Examples
If convenient, show some examples of the results you obtained during the project.
