# Project Description / Abstract

Discussions around climate change have become increasingly frequent and urgent across the globe.  While there are groups of people (including politicians) who are sceptical of climate change, a data-driven approach reveals that there is no doubting that we are in an era of global warming. This dataset has given us an opportunity to apply our learnings from this course to a topic that is very relevant in our lives, and to uncover firsthand the realities of climate change. Using this dataset we invesigated six key countries: United States, China, India, Spain, Nigeria and Venezuela.  We chose these countries for diversity in industrialisation, climate and culture, while also ensuring that the sample set was entirely Northern Hemisphere. Using the dataf from these countries we investigated:
1. The realities of global warming, ie. is it really happening? 
2. What is the relationship between industrialisation and warming? Can we see differences across countries?
3. How has warming impacted climate at a season level? Are some seasons warming/cooling in a different way to other seasons? 

# Dataset

Datafiles used for this analysis

GlobalTemperatures.csv

GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv

GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv

GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv 

The raw data comes from the Berkeley Earth data page. 


# Files and usage

There are three different python documents available: Christian's, David's and Allison's.  These all produce different analysis and results and were all contributors to the final report. These can be accessed from the respective branches.

We were also inspired by the project conducgted by VidhyasreeRamu using the same dataset.
