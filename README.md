# Project Description / Abstract

Discussions around climate change have become increasingly frequent and urgent across the globe.  While there are groups of people (including politicians) who are sceptical of climate change, a data-driven approach reveals that there is no doubting that we are in an era of global warming. This dataset has given us an opportunity to apply our learnings from this course to a topic that is very relevant in our lives, and to uncover firsthand the realities of climate change. Using this dataset we explored XXXXXXX COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE LAST, ONCE WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF OUR ANALYSIS xxxxx.

# Dataset

Datafiles used for this analysis

GlobalTemperatures.csv

GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv

GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv 

The raw data comes from the Berkeley Earth data page. 


# Files and usage

XXXXX UPDATE THIS LATER XXXXX

You should explain all the files that you include, as well as how to use them.

For example

    main.py: This file contains the core of the project.
    plot_graphs.py: This file contains functions that graph data into different formats
    ...
    ...
**Usage**: Run the following command line into your terminal:
